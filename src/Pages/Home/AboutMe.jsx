                        Before I started my journey in software development, I gradauted from Simon Fraser University with a bachelors in Science and a major in molecular biology and biochemistry.
                        After working in the industry for about 2 years. I was curious and passionate about the technology that was being used in the lab. 
                        This led me to pursue a career in software development and enroll in the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT.

                       On my free time, I enjoy being active and being outdoors. I love to hike, paddleboard, volleyball, and bouldering.
